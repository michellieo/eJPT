# eJPT Security Labs

Welcome to my **eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester) hands-on labs repository**.

This repository contains practical labs and notes created as part of my learning process while preparing for the eJPT certification. The goal of these labs is to strengthen my understanding of networking fundamentals, basic security concepts, and hands-on practice in a safe lab environment.

All labs are documented in **Markdown (.md)** format and are continuously updated as I progress.

> These labs are for **educational purposes only** and were performed in authorized lab environments.
