#  Host & Network Penetration Testing: Network-Based Attacks CTF 1.


## Objective
 Use network analysis techniques to identify and capture the flags related to the infection and attack

## Skills Learned
- Perform network-based attacks on target analyzing a captured network packet file test.pcap.

## Tools Used

- Wireshark

## Flags to Capture:
- Flag 1: What is the domain name(abcd.site) accessed by the infected user that returned a 200 OK response code?
- Flag 2: What is the IP address, MAC address of the infected Windows client?
- Flag 3: Which Wireshark filter can you use to determine the victim’s hostname from NetBIOS Name Service traffic, and what is the detected hostname for this malware infection?
- Flag 4: Which user got infected and ran the mystery_file.ps1 PowerShell script?
- Flag 5: What User-Agent string indicates the traffic generated by a PowerShell script?
- Flag 6: Which wallet extension ID is associated with the Coinbase wallet?
