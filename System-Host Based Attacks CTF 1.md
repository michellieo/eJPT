### Objective
 Perform system/host-based attacks on the target and capture all the flags hidden within the environment

- Flag 2: Valuable files are often on the C: drive. Explore it thoroughly. (target1.ine.local)
- Flag 3: By attempting to guess SMB user credentials, you may uncover important information that could lead you to the next flag. (target2.ine.local)
- Flag 4: The Desktop directory might have what you're looking for. Enumerate its contents. (target2.ine.local)
